# Louis' Network Tool

This is a network cli tool that is in the process of getting fully fleshed out.
Feel free to play around with it, it's super basic and not that hard to get the
hang of. It currently just runs a port scan and a couple dns queries. Hopefully
will get around to adding more capabilities as this would be nice to use for the
average system administrator.

Check out the [command docs](docs/cmds) for more command-specific information.
