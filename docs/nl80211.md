# Wireless Interface Information using nl80211

Guess what? Not a whole lot of documentation for nl80211! Yayyyyy :)

Not super surprising after working with netlink being that **it uses the netlink
protocol**. Anyways, mdlayher has already [created an implementation in
Go][mdlayher wifi pkg], so I should be able to get my footing. Looks like the
implementation is only available for Linux, so I won't be able to do a whole lot
today(possible open source contribution opportunity).

Will I work on this before I try to install Arch on my laptop? I don't know, but
I feel like the Fedora OS is just draining my yoga x86.

## Digging Deeper

nl80211 is the userspace interface for the configuration API [cfg80211][]. This
was made to replace the deprecated [Wireless Extensions][].
