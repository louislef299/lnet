# Wireless Interface Information using nl80211

Guess what? Not a whole lot of documentation for nl80211! Yayyyyy :)

Not super surprising after working with netlink being that **it uses the netlink
protocol**. Anyways, mdlayher has already [created an implementation in
Go][mdlayher wifi pkg], so I should be able to get my footing. Looks like the
implementation is only available for Linux, so I won't be able to do a whole lot
today(possible open source contribution opportunity).

Will I work on this before I try to install Arch on my laptop? I don't know, but
I feel like the Fedora OS is just draining my yoga x86.

## Digging Deeper

nl80211 is the userspace interface for the configuration API [cfg80211][]. This
was made to replace the deprecated [Wireless Extensions][].

## Reimage usb on Linux with Arch ISO

### Reformat the usb

1. find the usb drive with `sudo df -Ti`
2. unmount usb to prep for reformat with(ex mount @ /dev/sda1) `sudo umount /dev/sda1`
3. reformat to FAT32 filesystem: `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1`
4. verify usb formatting: `sudo fsck /dev/sdb1`

*Side Note*: Reasons why FAT32 is a good choice; here are the filesystem comparisons:

File System | Supported File Size | Compatibility | Ideal Usage
----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -----------
FAT32       | up to 4 GB          | Windows, Mac, Linux | For maximum compatibility
NTFS        | 16 EiB – 1 KB       | Windows, Mac (read-only), most Linux distributions | For internal drives and Windows system files
exFAT       | 16 EiB – 1 KB       | Windows, Mac, Linux (requires extra drivers to access) | For files larger than 4 GB

## Download Arch ISO

Just ran:
`wget -v https://mirrors.umd.edu/archlinux/iso/2024.04.01/archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso`

Then get the gpg file:
`wget -v https://mirrors.umd.edu/archlinux/iso/2024.04.01/archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso.sig`

Validate the package signature with gpg by running after both are downloaded:
`gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso.sig`

Should return something like:

```bash
gpg: assuming signed data in 'archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso'
gpg: Signature made Mon 01 Apr 2024 01:00:16 PM CDT
gpg:                using EDDSA key 3E80CA1A8B89F69CBA57D98A76A5EF9054449A5C
gpg:                issuer "pierre@archlinux.org"
gpg: Good signature from "Pierre Schmitz <pierre@archlinux.org>" [unknown]
gpg:                 aka "Pierre Schmitz <pierre@archlinux.de>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: The key's User ID is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 3E80 CA1A 8B89 F69C BA57  D98A 76A5 EF90 5444 9A5C
```

Once validated, copied the iso over to my mounted drive with the following:

```bash
dd bs=4M if=/home/louislefebvre/Downloads/wget-arch/archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso \
of=/dev/disk/by-id/usb-SanDisk_Ultra_4C531001380617112524-0:0 \
conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progres
```
