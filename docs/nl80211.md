# Wireless Interface Information using nl80211

Guess what? Not a whole lot of documentation for nl80211! Yayyyyy :)

Not super surprising after working with netlink being that **it uses the netlink
protocol**. Anyways, mdlayher has already [created an implementation in
Go][mdlayher wifi pkg], so I should be able to get my footing. Looks like the
implementation is only available for Linux, so I won't be able to do a whole lot
today(possible open source contribution opportunity).

Will I work on this before I try to install Arch on my laptop? I don't know, but
I feel like the Fedora OS is just draining my yoga x86.

## Digging Deeper

nl80211 is the userspace interface for the configuration API [cfg80211][]. This
was made to replace the deprecated [Wireless Extensions][].

## Reimage usb on Linux with Arch ISO

### Reformat the usb

1. find the usb drive with `sudo df -Ti`
2. unmount usb to prep for reformat with(ex mount @ /dev/sda1) `sudo umount /dev/sda1`
3. reformat to FAT32 filesystem: `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1`
4. verify usb formatting: `sudo fsck /dev/sdb1`

*Side Note*: Reasons why FAT32 is a good choice; here are the filesystem comparisons:

File System | Supported File Size | Compatibility | Ideal Usage
----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -----------
FAT32       | up to 4 GB          | Windows, Mac, Linux | For maximum compatibility
NTFS        | 16 EiB – 1 KB       | Windows, Mac (read-only), most Linux distributions | For internal drives and Windows system files
exFAT       | 16 EiB – 1 KB       | Windows, Mac, Linux (requires extra drivers to access) | For files larger than 4 GB
